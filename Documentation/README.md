- [Running the program](#running-the-program)
- [Implementaion details](#implementaion-details)
- [Program Design and Flow](#program-design-and-flow)
## Dependencies
The following dependencies are needed to build the program
- [boost](https://www.boost.org/)
- [cmake](https://cmake.org/)
- c++17 compiler (gcc 8+ or clang 7+)

The following commands can be used on a fedora based distribution. Other distributions should have a similar command
```
sudo dnf install gcc boost cmake
```
Alternatively the following should be used for installing clang instead of gcc
```
sudo dnf install clang boost cmake
```

## Build
The project uses cmake to build the program. Cmake will try and find the dependencies and automatically link them. It creates a makefile which is used to compile and build the program. After installing the dependencies, the following can be used to build the software on a linux system
1. Clone the repo to obtain the project
    ```
    git clone git@github.com:jdao55/GSP-Recognition.git
    ```
2. Enter project directory
    ```
    cd GSP-Recognition
    ```
3. Create build folder
    ```
    mkdir build && cd build
    ```
4. Run Cmake
    ```
    cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ../
    ```
    or using following for debug
    ```
    cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ../
    ```
5. Compile project
    ```
    make
    ```
    or use following command to compile with more thread/jobs (faster compiler time)
    ```
    make -j[n]
    ```
    n= number or jobs/threads
    ex
    ```
    make -j4
    ```
Note if no new targets are added, cmake does need to be run again, the follow can be used to compile the code, every subsequent time.
 ```
    make -j4
 ```
 Here is the cmake documentation for further reading on how to use cmake https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/guide/tutorial/index.html

## Running the program
The program can be run by entering the following command in the terminal  
```gspgraph input_filename```  
ex.  
```./gspgraph ../examples/4SP.txt```  
### Input file format
The input file represents a graph. The format consits of the number of vertices followed by the edegs in the graph
```
number_of_vertices
v1 v2
v2 v3
.
.
.
```
Ex.  
```
4
0 2
1 3
2 1
```
Please see example folder for more examples of the input files

## Program Design and Flow
This summary provides the rational for features in the implementation that are not obvious from
looking at the algorithm. Comments in the source code provide descriptions of the function and usage of the more
obvious implementation details.

The program takes as input any connected boost graph and determines if it is series-parallel or outerplanar or not.
To certify that the program has made the correct determination it generates a construction sequence certificate
for the series-parallel construction of the graph and a boundary edge list certificate for evaluation of outerplanar 
graphs. The program also does the validation of the series-parallel certificate. Validation of the outerplanar 
certificate is left for future work, as well as fixing the k23 generation.

To accomplish its tasks the program first decomposes the graph into its various biconnected components. It then uses hashmaps 
and lists to find if there are any vertexes in more then 2 biconnected components, or more then 2 articulation vertexes in any biconnected components. In the event of either of these conditions we return a generated certificate for this case as it can not be SP.

If the graph can still be SP, we use the hashmaps and lists to order(sort) the biconnected components so that one biconnected component leads into the next one.  

The program then prepares to use the fundamental area of the algorithm on a 
biconnected component. If it is not the first or last component, we need to make sure there is an edge beetween the 2 articulation vertexes so that the construction tree ends with this edge. For this to work this edge must be used first. To perform this we order the adjacency lists so that it is first. If we had to add this edge we mark this in the graph - so that the graph knows that this edge was actually added in afterwards.  

Finally we perform a recursive depth first search (DFS) of the input graph to produce a spanning tree and then as the recursion unwinds it builds a possible series-parallel construction sequence using all edges of the
graph. The construction sequence is the certificate that shows that the graph has a series-parallel construction. 
The construction sequence is assembled from collections of edges that would form ears, if an ear decomposition of the 
graph was produced. As the construction sequence is being assembled the program checks the connection of source and 
sink vertices of the segments being assembled to determine if the segments are being assembled into a forbidden structure. 
If a k4 subdivision is detected the program stops processing if a k23 subdivision is detected the program sets a flag 
variable (k23found) and continues. If no k4 subdivision is found then the graph is series-parallel, if in addition no 
k23 subdivision is found then the graph is outplanar. If the program completes the construction sequence it then validates
the construction sequence to prove that determination of a series-parallel graph by the program is indeed correct. 

Internally the graph being processed is represented by an array of adjacency lists, one for each vertex in the graph. 
After confirming the input file name the main function (main.cpp) populates a Boost graph object.
from there the we use the boost functions to decompse the graph as described above into our internal graph sturture which uses adjacency lists. An adjacency list is a simple doubly linked list of Node structures, both defined in AdjacencyList.hpp.  These vertices are adjacent to each other thus when populating the array of adjacency 
lists a Node representing each vertex number is added to the adjacency list of the other vertex. Thus Nodes are added in 
pairs. Each Node contains a field to hold the vertex number it represents and a pointer to the other Node that was 
created with it at the time of entry. This pointer field is referred to as the "partner" Node. The Node structure has 
a destructor function that properly removes the Node from the adjacency list in which it is found. The purpose behind 
this is to ensure that Nodes can be removed from the adjacency lists in O(1) time and that when attempting to remove an edge 
from the graph that the specific pair of Nodes representing the endpoints of that edge are removed. To remove a Node from
an adjacency list it is only necessary to call the "delete" function on the pointer to that Node. (Thus avoiding having 
to search the list for the Node before attempting to remove it which would be O(n) and to delete the entire array of 
adjacency lists would be O(n*n).) To remove a specific edge, we can call delete on the pointer to the Node representing one
of the vertexes defining the edge and also call delete on the pointer to its partner Node. The array of adjacency lists is 
used in the creation of the construction sequence and deleting specific edges is done in the validation of the construction 
sequence. 

The partner node idea is just so that we can use the adjacency list 
to move from one vertex to the other vertex that this node represents its
adjacency to.

When we use the run function, run selects a pointer to a Node from the adjacency lists whose vertexNumber is is the root passed into run. It assigns this pointer as the root Node of the graph and assigns it's number as the root vertex number. It passes this Node pointer as an argument to the initial call to the function GenCS(). By doing so the 
DFS performed by GenCS() will will be rooted at this vertex. This is so we can force a particular construction by specifing the source and sink.

Tree.h defines the Tree structure. The Tree structure is however just a wrapper for a binary tree whose nodes are 
Sequence structures defined in Sequence.h. The Tree structure maintains a pointer to the root Sequence structure in the 
binary tree. Operations on a Tree are just operations on the underlying Sequence binary tree. The Sequence binary tree is
used to hold the constructions steps performed to series and parallel connect edges of the graph together. The internal 
nodes of the tree have fields which hold the type of composition used to connect its child nodes (comp) which will
be either "SC" for series connect, or "PC" for parallel  connect and fields to indicate the source vertex number (s) 
and the sink vertex number (t) of the resulting composition. The other fields in an internal node are not used by the program and are assigned null. The leaf nodes of the binary tree are the edges being connected. Leaf nodes have comp set 
to "EDGE" and have nullptr as children. Leaf nodes have the edge's source vertex number for s and sink vertex number for t.
It also has the orientation field (orientation) populated with either "BACK" if it is a back edge or "TREE" if it is a tree 
edge in the DFS tree. It also has source Node (s_node) and sink Node (t_node) fields populated with pointers to Nodes in
the adjacency lists that have vertex numbers s and t respectively. The s_node and t_node values are partners of 
each other so a leaf node has links back to a specific edge placed in the adjacency lists. Tree.h also defines the 
function to output a representation of the Tree to a text file (print_tree()), and a function to serial connect two Trees and
a function to parallel connect two Trees to form larger Trees. 

The final construction sequence (seq) returned by the initial call to GenCS() is a Tree and the fact that leaf nodes in the
underlying Sequence binary tree are linked to specific edges in the adjacency lists is important to the construction 
sequence validation function. After the initial call to GenCS() made in the main program returns the 
isValidCertificate() function is called with seq as its argument. A post-order traversal of the Sequence binary tree
in seq is performed and as a leaf node is encountered delete is called on the s_node and t_node Node pointers of the leaf
thus removing that specific edge from the adjacency lists in O(1) time. Also as the traversal returns from an "SC" 
connected internal node, the adjacency list of the vertex which would be the common connection between the child nodes
is checked that it is empty.  If it is not empty an exception is thrown. If the traversal completes without throwing an 
exception and if the construction sequence is valid then all nodes in the adjacency lists should have been removed. The 
function checks that all adjacency lists are empty. If so the program outputs that the certificate is valid. 

GenCS() is passed a pair of pointers to Nodes in the adjacency lists as arguments.  This differs from the algorithm which 
passes vertex numbers. The relationship between the two arguments in the program is the same as the relationship 
between the vertices in the algorithm. The vertexNumber of the second Node is the parent of the vertexNumber of the first 
Node in the DFS tree.  Also the two Nodes are partners of each other. The exception is the initial call to GenCS() in
which the first node is the root Node and there is no parent vertex. This does not cause a problem as the function checks
that the first Node vertexNunber is not equal to the root (0) before it tries to access the value of the parent Node 
vertexNumber. The reason for doing this is that GenCS() creates a Tree representing the parent edge before being 
added to the construction sequence Tree, it needs pointers to the actual pair of partner Nodes that represent the edge as 
arguments for the constructor for the Tree. In GenCS() the vertex numbers of the arguments are still used, they are 
obtained from the vertexNumber fields of the Nodes. 

GenCS() is always called with a pair of partner Nodes as arguments execpt for the initial call). GenCS() recursively
calls itself while processing the Nodes in an adjacency list. It makes the call if the vertexNumber of the Node from the 
adjacency list has not been visited before in the DFS. This makes the vertexNumber of the Node a child of the vertex 
number of the adjacency list in the DFS tree. The arguments passed to the call of GenCS() is the pointer to the Node 
from the adjacency list and the pointer to its partner Node. Since the vertexNumber of the Node from the adjacency list is
adjacent to the vertex of the adjacency list. The partner Node will have vertexNumber equal to that of the adjacency list. 
Thus the relationship that the second argument Node vertexNumber is the parent of the first argument Node 
vertexNunber in the DFS tree is maintained. Because GenCS() is always called with the pointer to the Node from the 
adjacency list and its partner which can be obtained from the first argument the second argument is redundant but has been
retained because it more closely matches the function signature shown in the algorithm. 

The assignment of source vertex (s) and sink vertex (t) in the construction of a Tree which is only an edge conforms to the 
same usage specified in the algorithm. However the values of s and t in a Tree that has been composed of multiple edges
such as the Trees "seq" and "seq_u" in the program correspond to the opposite labels when referenced by the algorithm. Thus
when the algorithm asks for "source of seq" or "source of seq_u" the appropriate value to return is the t 
value of the seq or seq_u Tree constructed in the program. This is a consequence of the labeling of source and sink for
a path being opposite to that for an edge. 

When the graph definition file is read in by the main program it creates an array of Vertex structures, one Vertex for each 
vertex in the graph definition file.  Each Vertex holds information associated with that vertex from the graph while
the program operates. One of the fields in the Vertex structure is the adjacency list for that vertex. The complete
definition of the Vertex structure is given in Vertex.h. Another field is "ear" which holds a pointer to a Tree that 
represents a back edge that would be computed if the ear() function defined in the paper accompanying the algorithm was
calculated for the parent edge of the corresponding vertex in the DFS tree. That is it is the value of ear(v->w) where w is
the vertex associated with that Vertex structure. The ear() function defined in the paper is never computed in the 
algorithm, instead the value of ear() of some edge is simply assigned a value. Only the ear(v->w) value, where v->w
is the parent edge of w in the DFS tree is stored in the Vertex structure for vertex w. The ear() value for other edges,
in particular back edges, are not stored in the program. This is done to avoid the complications associated with 
identifying arbitrary edges in some storage container within the program. The only time when the ear() of some edge other
than a parent edge is encountered is when a back edge is passed as an argument to update_ear_of_parent(). There is no
need to look up or compute the ear() of a back edge as the value is simply the back edge itself. In 
update_ear_of_parent() if argument f is a back edge then a variable local to update_ear_of_parent() is used to hold 
ear(f) and its value is just the input back edge f. If f is a tree edge it is the parent edge of some vertex w, in this case
the local variable for ear(f) is assigned the value stored in the ear field in the Vertex structure associated to vertex w.

When generate negative certificate (k23 and k4). The program saves the path to a certificate file. When verifying
the negative certificate, an array of int stores all vertex number of the endpoints for each path.

Verify_K4_Structure  will take this array and create a map to check that how many path terminated on corresponding vertex as value if the number of distinct endpoints is not 4 or the number of path terminated on one endpont is not exactly 3, our certificate is wrong which means the program has a bug. Otherwise, the map will be returned which will be used to verify the edges in the negative certificate (Verify_K23_Structure does a similar thing)

Check_Edge takes two integers as source and the sink of the an edge. And also takes a int indicates the path# and an array
that contains all the endpoints. It simply check path# of the vertex vertices[s] and vertices[t]. If s and t is not endpoints but has already assigned other path# which means that the negative certificate we have is not dis-join, then return false. Also, if s and t are
not in the other one's adjacency list which means {s,t} is not in g, false will be returned as well. Otherwise, it will return true. If it is true check edge will also add it to the vector that represents this path. These paths are then used in the certificate.
     
Check_Ear takes a Seqence , a path# and an array that stores endpoints as input. It will check all the edges in such Sequence whether is legal or not by calling Check_Edge  for each Edge.  Check_Path has similar functionality which checks all the edges in the path by calling the Check_Edge.  There is a version of the check_ear which takes in an vector. As the ear is traversed we add the edges into the path vector.  This is so that the spandop file can add an ear into the certificate vector. Finally, there is a function called check_path_reverse - which checks the path in a similar way to the normal check_path - except the edges are 
added to the certication path in reverse.

Verify_Edge is as same as Check_Edge excepts it only check the adjacency list of the two endpoints of the edge to see whether this edge is in graph g or not

The certificate class holds all of the details for the certicate. It holds the paths to be confirmed when there is a negative 
certiciate, the details on which vertexes or components fail the checks, the outplanar boundary path and the connection tree.  
In addition to information it contains functions to check the certicate against the full original graph. During decomposition a second internal graph object is created and all edges are added to it. This graph is then passed into the certification algorithm
which will verify the certificate against this graph.

For the certification process a few additional functions were added. To confirm k4 or k23 graphs, we use the vector of edge pairs to find the endpoints - and fill in an array.  We use the k4 or k23 verifier again to check that these paths would work. We then use confirmPaths to confirm that this path does exist in the graph. This uses the check_edge function to check that the edges exist. This works since we are using a new graph - so the previous tracing does not affect the result.  To confirm the construction tree we use the isValidCertificateFull function.  It does a similar thing to the other isValidCertificate and postReduction functions except it works on a sequence that is not made for this graph.  These functions 
use the vertex numbers and adjacency lists instead.  These functions also confirm that in parallel constructions, the tails and sources match, and for series composition the source of one is the tail of the other in order.

When reporting k23 or k4 subgraphs in the csgen function we first use the basic ears to identify several of the endpoints.  If needed we then identify another endpoint, which is different then the endpoints already identified. In some cases there may be a seperate set of checks if the found ear is trivial. This is needed since trivial ears do not have a sequence for them. When searching for a seperate ear - we look at each adjacent vertex's ear.  If that ear is -1 that means it is a trivial ear. This is because it uses a vetex whose DFS number is higher and thus the ear is uninitilized. Whenever we search for an ear in this way we need to be careful not to enter -1 as an endpoint, we need to use the vertex number as the ear sink instead.

In cases where a k4 graph contains a forced edge - we keep the edge in the cert paths. It is included when testing endpoints, however we pass in the 2 vertexes into the confirm path function so that we can skip the edge that is missing. It is also forgone in a similar way when printing out the details of the certficate.
