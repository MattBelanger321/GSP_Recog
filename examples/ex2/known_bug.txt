There is a known bug in the way that parallel compositions are created.
Sometimes, one of the sequences in paired upside down.  
The source of one is matched with the tail of the other and vice versa.
To see how I know that it is happening uncomment the lines marked by #DEGUG_PARALLEL
in the tree.c file.  It will at time output that the sources and tails don't match.

In the end this occasionaly means that when combinning the biconnected components 
the source and sink no longer match what the run function set up.  

An example of this is the 2SP.txt file.
